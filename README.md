# AI Patient Chatbot

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer factual questions about synthetic patient health records. The system retrieves relevant information from a structured database and generates accurate, summarized responses grounded in the retrieved data. This is a question-answering system focused on information retrieval and summarization—it is **not** a conversational roleplay or diagnostic assistant.

## Tech Stack
